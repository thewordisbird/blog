## Getting Started

I'm Justin. I'm a software engineer. I want to learn. I want to teach.

Inherited from my dad, I've always had a knack for making "things". It started with working on dirt bikes and progresse to cars in my teens. My dad had always been a car guy. His 1972 DeThomosa Pantera which he twin turbed carries memories of the quickest thing I've ever been in. From that I knew one thing...Turbos are cool! At 15 I was given a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX.

My mom would take drive with me to West Valley Occupational Center so I could take mechanics classes and have access to a full shop to work on my car. Before I knew it I was a bit over 16 and looking for a job as a Mechanic. With a resume that listed roller hockey as an interest I was lucky enough to be hired by Robert Henderson at Rydell Chevrolet. To this day I remember my first ticket. Take a car to the tire shop for a tire repair. I grabed the keys from the dispatch and headed to the back lock clicking the lock button to find the car... It was a brand new red corvette. This had to be a mistake. I walked back to Robert's office, "Um, this is a corvette, is this the right car?" In my mind the question was, "I'm 16, do you think I should be driving a Corvette?" His response was classic. "Is that the car on the ticket? Whelp, then it's the right car.". And that's why I love Corvettes :)

Knowing I liked cars, I decided I'd become a Mechanical Engineer. I got into Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. A school with the motto "learn by doing". The education was great and while I might have prioritized racing dirtbikes over the extra effort to get good grades, I learned how to learn.

I didn't know what I wanted to do when I graduated so I went to work in the family business mainly making spreadsheets to help the accounting department. This was my introduction to the power of code. I had a ton of repetitive tasks to complie the various reports and perform periodic reconciliations. First basic excel formals, then more advanced combinations of formulas and finally to VBA. VBA was the key. All of a sudden I could make excel do anything I wanted it to do.

I don't know the story, but one day the company decided to no longer use the IT consultant we had been using and I was asked to take over IT duties. I was given a sheet of paper with various passowrds and shown the server. I had no previous knowledge of anything required to do IT, but I knew how to learn. Over the next 7 years I learned about networking, security, Avaya phones systems but best of all I was able to work with the revenue management team to autmate report generation by driving the virtualized termianl to the mainframe and bringing the data into excel. All this with VBA!

In this time I was able to make my first real piece of software. It was a asset scheduling tool to allow multiple locations to book certain assets by more specific needs. Of course I wrote it in VBA and with exel as my "frontend" and and Access databse. Networking was done over a VPN with the database stored on a central server. It was not fast, It wasn't all that pretty, but it worked, and it was somehow quite reliable. It connected 5 locations and was used for well over 5 years.

The company was sold and there went my job. I knew IT wasn't a passion, but I loved making software. I had started to play with python in the past year or so so I decided I'd like to be a software engineer. Over the next few years while working on VBA freelance projects, I learned to code. Then I learned to alogrithim and datastructure, then I learned javascript, react and how to program for the web. Then I got a job.

> "...there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones." - Donal Rumsfeld (I wish someone else had come up with this quote)

The learning took a long time and was an emotional roller coaster. Some concepts came quick but most seemed to be days or even weeks of working thrugh examples trying to grasp the how. Software is humbling. You have to accept that you can't know it all and somethings have to be treated as a black box. The only thing you can do is try to keep learning, converting known unknowns to knowns, and exposing more unknown unkowns, making them known unkowns.

This blog will try to fill the gap in content I wish I could find more of. The web is filled with incredible contributors and teachers. The thoughts that have come to mind have been open source deep dives hopefully leading to some open source contributions and maybe even a usuable open source package of my own :)
